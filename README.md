# Overview

This is a simple gui using rust with the native windows gui package. It simply loads a file directory, and if you right click and select info, displays very simple info about the file.
I wanted to make a project in Rust because I have heard that it's a cool language and used in a lot of business projects, as well as being on the rise in popularity.

# Future Work

The project was meant to be a shell for future improvements.

- The context menu offers a way to put in additional objects, like linking to external apps or new proecesses
- The project could be beautified a bit and made more clean.
- The file system integration could use icons to show if it was a folder or file and functionality extended to match accordingly.
